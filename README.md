## I make simple nerd webapps which will save you time 😄
- On my GitHub you will find many repos, note that some of them are absolute trash. The pinned ones are legit good though!
- 👀 I’m interested in literally anything, NEXTJS , RUST , C++ , you name it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RUST 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NEXT JS, REACT NATIVE , and seriously anything!
